# Contact-Tracing without GUI
The program can be run in the Python environment, and it will guide the user through each step of the contact tracing information collection process.

# ❓ How this program run: Contact-Tracing (with GUI)
- Creates a covid contact tracing app with GUI (Tkinter)
- Create a program that ask user for information found in covid contact tracing app
- Prompt each frame for each number
- if in question number 3 and question number 4 += "yes" and if question number 5 ="Yes-Positve or Yes-pending"
        # When was your most visit to this location?
        # Since then until today, what places have you been? (beside home)
        # PROMPT ONLY IF it met the above conditions
  - However this is still in process as it can't run successfully
  - Still doesn't write to csv file
  - On process coding

# ❓ How this program run: Contact-Tracing (without GUI)
- The provided program collects contact tracing information from the user and saves it to a CSV file named "contact_tracing_info.csv." The program uses the get_user_input function to get valid responses from the user and handles any exceptions that may occur during input.
- The program prompts the user to enter contact details, including name, email address, and phone number.
- The program asks if the user has been vaccinated for COVID-19, and the user selects the appropriate option from the given choices.
- The program asks if the user has experienced any COVID-like symptoms in the past 7 days. The user responds with "y" for Yes and "n" for No for each symptom.
- The program asks if the user has had exposure to a probable confirmed COVID case in the last 14 days, and the user responds with "y" for Yes and "n" for No.
- The program asks if the user has had contact with someone with COVID-like symptoms in the past 7 days, and the user responds with "y" for Yes and "n" for No.
- The program asks if the user has been tested for COVID-19 in the last 14 days, and the user selects the appropriate option from the given choices.
- If the user responded "Yes" to exposure or contact with COVID-like symptoms, and the testing status is "Yes-positive" or "Yes-pending," the program asks for the location of the most recent visit and the places visited since then.
- The program asks for other contact details, including name, relation to the contact person, and contact number.
- The collected information is written to the "contact_tracing_info.csv" file as a new row in the CSV file.
- The program asks if the user wants to record information for another contact tracing. If the user responds with "n" for No, the program stops running.

_Note: the provided program contains exception handling to handle invalid inputs and ensures that the user provides valid responses. If the user enters invalid input, the program will display an error message and prompt the user to try again._
